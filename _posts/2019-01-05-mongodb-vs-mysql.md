## Overview: 

**What is MongoDB?**

_As per the official MongoDB documentation:_

> _ MongoDB is a document database with the scalability and flexibility that you want with the querying and indexing that you need_



**How does MongoDB work?**

> MongoDB stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents, meaning fields can vary from document to document and data structure can be changed over time__



**What are the alternatives?**

When choosing a database for your project, one of the biggest and most important decision is picking a relational (SQL) or non-relational (noSQL) data structure.

While both options can get the job done, there are mentionable key differences that each developer must keep in mind.
