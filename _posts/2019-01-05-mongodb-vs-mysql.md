> _ MongoDB is a document database with the scalability and flexibility that you want with the querying and indexing that you need_


**How does MongoDB work?**

> MongoDB stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents, meaning fields can vary from document to document and data structure can be changed over time__


**What are the alternatives?**

When choosing a database for your project, one of the biggest and most important decision is picking a relational (SQL) or non-relational (noSQL) data structure.

While both options can get the job done, there are mentionable key differences that each developer must keep in mind.

**Is the test live?**

YES! the test along with all used code can be checked through [c1.maroun.xyz](c1.maroun.xyz)



## What are the benefits of using MongoDB

**MongoDB's schema less nature**

MongoDB is a document database in which one collection holds different documents. Number of fields, content and size of the document can differ from one document to another.


**Ease of scale-out**

Unlike RDBMS databases, MongoDB is easy to scale since it requires a lot less resources.


**Structure of a single object is clear.**


**No complex joins.**


**Deep query-ability. MongoDB supports dynamic queries on documents using a document-based query language that's nearly as powerful as SQL.**


**Uses internal memory for storing the (windowed) working set, enabling faster access of data.**
